# 🌡️ Tomorrow's Temperature Predictor

A simple Python mini-project that uses simulated temperature data to predict the temperature for the next day using basic statistical analysis. Built during the **Zero to Python Hero Bootcamp** by [Let's Upgrade](https://letsupgrade.in/).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Python can be used for basic predictive analysis. By simulating 30 days of temperature data and applying a 7-day rolling average, we forecast tomorrow's temperature and visualize the results using **Matplotlib**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **Google Colab** – for running and testing code

## 📈 Features

- Simulates temperature data for the past 30 days  
- Applies a 7-day rolling average for smoothing  
- Predicts the next day's temperature using the mean of the last 7 days  
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted temperature trend
